Unfortunatley, I was not able to fully complete the project. When reading the project initally, I
thought I would have the time to complete the project on my own, taking in to consideration the scope of the first assignment. By the time I realized how much larger the scope of this project was
it was too late find a group.I will try to find a group for the final project. If you can help me
find a group as well it would be much appreciated.
